Application is to get count of word from server files.

Procedure to setup this application:
1. Deploy the war available on Server
2. After deployment of this war , your tomcat webapps will create folder with application name.
3. Go to this folder.
4. Find config folder
5. Inside config folder you will find "http-word-app.properties" file. This is central configuration file for this application.
6. Provide list of absolute paths for files that you want to load and make searchable.
7. Once done, save this file.

How to Use:

1. Goto http://<host>:<port>/HTTPWordCount/
2. Browser will give some output. This should be an error, because you are suppose to provide query parameters like ../?query=<word to serach>
3. Update url like httpL//<host>:<port>/?query=word
4. This will return output in json.
For Example: 
URL : ..../?query=kailas
Output: {"count":1, "query":"kailas"}
5. Additionally you can choose to do search by ignoring case. For this add one more queryparameter called "ignoreCase"
For Example:
URL : ..../?query=kailas&ignoreCase=true
Output: {"count":2, "query":"kailas", "ignoreCase":true}
